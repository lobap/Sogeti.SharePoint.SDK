        The trusted facade pattern means that the LOB Service trusts that our SharePoint application has authenticated its users
        and that the SharePoint application is providing the appropriate PartnerID for it's users. Because of this trust relationship,
        the LOB Services don't have to re-validate the username/password of the users.

          for that. The Contoso.LOB.Services.Security.SecurityHelper class can then look inside the claimsset and find the username.  -->
